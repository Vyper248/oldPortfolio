                <div class="projectInfo">
                    The third course I did, going more in-depth into web development in general.

                <h4>Reddit Competition Helper</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    Fairly basic tool I made to help with competitions on Reddit, where users would leave a comment to say which country they're in. This extracts all those comments and puts them into a list separated by country.

                <h4>Reddit Streamer</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    Small website I made to keep up to date with my favourite Reddit subs. Automatically loads in new submissions based on your selected sub(s). Shows post text content, and has modal popups to show comments / embedded videos.

                <h4>Reddit React App</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    Second React app I created, this time using React-Router for navigation. It's another version of Reddit, this time more in-line with the Reddit website, with more sorting options. Currently using pre-configured sub list. Also decided to create this with a dark theme.

                <h4>Learn English With Sarah</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    This project began with the creation of a landing page for the Complete Web Development course, and is now turning into a full website for my girlfriend's business.

                <h4>Live HTML Editor</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    There was a video showing the basics of 'fs' on the Web Dev Course, so I thought I'd try making a live html editor which saves changes to the server. So any changes made are permananent and visible to everyone (although heroku will reset when it starts up).
